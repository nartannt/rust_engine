Right now the main goal is cleaning up the code, creating the modules, finishing some basic interface and getting a minimal project working.
Development will then consist in developing an example game (a kingdom rush clone) and adding features as needed developping both in parallel.
Once a reasonable set of features are implemented work on a "real" game and refine the engine as the game demands it.

TODO (general) :
    - Reorganise all files
    - Make modules out of the relevant parts
    - Decide on an interface
    - Get minimal project working
    - Lighting

TODO (precise steps) :
    - Figure out a way for scene to be able to load all its unloaded game objects at once
    - Move scene and go creation outside game.rs
    - make game draw the scenes in self.scenes
    - Look up how to make modules

Interface:

Steps to creating a gameobject:
    - create the gameobject (the default transform will be the orgin)
    - add or change components to the gameobject (this can be done at any time)
        * components include:
            -- transform
            -- model
            -- behaviour function (like monobehaviour in unity)
